# SHIRAH – Reward Points System (Master Reference)

This document explains **everything related to Reward Points** in the SHIRAH app. It is designed as a **long-term reference note** for founders, developers, or stakeholders and is fully aligned with **Google Play & AdMob policies**.

---

## 1. What are Reward Points?

**Reward Points** are a non-cash, internal value system used to:

* Motivate consistent activity
* Hide multi-level incentives (MLM-style) safely
* Gamify ads, referrals, and contributions
* Control real cash outflow

> Reward Points are **NOT money** and **NOT directly withdrawable**.

---

## 2. Wallet Architecture (Summary)

SHIRAH uses a **3-layer wallet system**:

1. **Reward Points** – motivation & contribution layer (non-cash)
2. **Wallet Balance** – real money (withdrawable)
3. **Voucher System** – utility bridge (reward → service)

Income from real activities is auto-added to Wallet Balance. Only Reward Points require manual conversion.
